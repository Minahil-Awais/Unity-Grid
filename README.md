# UnityGrid: Global Crisis Response & Resource Optimizer

**UnityGrid** is an advanced logistical framework designed to bridge the gap between global resource surplus and local disaster needs. By centralizing humanitarian data, UnityGrid ensures that aid reaches the most vulnerable locations—from **Istanbul** to **Tokyo**—without delay.

## 🏮 The Vision
Disasters do not respect borders. **UnityGrid** was built on the principle of "Global Solidarity," providing a standardized platform for tracking life-saving supplies and specialized human capital. This project serves as a prototype for how Management Information Systems (MIS) can be leveraged to minimize human suffering during environmental crises.

## 🚀 Impactful Capabilities
- **Cross-Border Logistics**: Pre-configured with international hubs, including high-priority zones in **Türkiye** (Antakya, Istanbul) and global cities (Tokyo, Beirut).
- **Specialist Deployment**: A rapid-search algorithm to filter volunteers by mission-critical skills like "Medical" or "Rescue."
- **Inventory Resilience**: Object-Oriented architecture allows for real-time scaling of aid centers as new crisis zones emerge.

## 🛠️ Technical Profile
- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python.
- **Naming Standards**: Strict adherence to **PascalCase** for classes (`AidCenter`, `UnityGridEngine`) to ensure enterprise-level readability.
- **Data Logic**: Implements dictionary-based inventory mapping for $O(1)$ efficiency in resource updates.

## 📖 Application Context
This project is a cornerstone of my portfolio for the **Türkiye Bursları** scholarship. It represents my commitment to using Computer Science as a tool for international cooperation and social welfare, specifically focusing on the logistical lessons learned from Türkiye's disaster response history.
